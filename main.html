                            <br> I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and have lived there my whole life. I have two older 
                            siblings named Ali and Pete. I am really close with them but I rarely see them because they live
                            so far away. I have always loved traveling and my favorite places that I have visited have been Paris
                            and Amsterdam. South Africa has always been my dream destination so I am very excited for these next
                            six weeks.

                            Science and Applied Mathematics. I loved being in a new place and making new friends. My extra-curriculars on
